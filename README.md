# karabiner.json Creator

This is a personal project to version control and automate the configuration file of [Karabiner Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/), a powerful and stable keyboard customizer for MacOs.

The project arose from the painstaking process of adding new rules to karabiner using the UserUX, which does not keep track of changes as well as provide no formatting for json files.

By separating each rule in a single file and being able to edit it in vscode, changes are much easier to make but also version controlled using git.
